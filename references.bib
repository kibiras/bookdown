abstract = {Cloud data migration is the procedure of moving information, localhost applications, services, and data to the distributed cloud computing infrastructure. The success of this data migration process is depending on several aspects like planning and impact analysis of existing enterprise systems. One of the most common operations is moving locally stored data in a public cloud computing environment. This paper, through a multivocal literature review, identifies the key advantages and consequences of migrating data into the cloud. There are five different cloud migration strategies and models prescribed to evaluate the performance, identifying security requirements, choosing a cloud provider, calculating the cost, and making any necessary organizational changes. The results of this research paper can give a road map for the data migration journey and can help decision makers towards a safe and productive migration to a cloud computing environment.}

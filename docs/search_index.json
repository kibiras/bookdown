Accessibility around the world, and iii. Flexibility and highly automated processes Cloud Computing SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. SaaS refers to Software as a Service in this a system with operating systems, hardware and network provided or we can say a pre developed system. PaaS refers to Platform as a Service in this the operating system, hardware and network are provided and customer/user installs or develops its own software. And IaaS refers to Infrastructure as a Service in this the customer has the knowledge about all the stuff. There are no publically available standards specific to cloud computing security. In this paper we propose the following standards for maintaining security in an unsafe environment. (Surbiryala and Rong 2019) According to (Srivastava and Khan 2018) benefits of Cloud Computing includes Cost Saving, Flexibility, Enhanced Security Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services References "],["part-i.html", "Chapter 1 Part I 1.1 Managing SLA (SLO) requirements on clouds through scalability and reliability 1.2 Migration to cloud approaches 1.3 Use case", " Chapter 1 Part I Software as a Service (SaaS) Platform as a Service(PaaS) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Deployment types- public, private, community, hybrid 1.1 Managing SLA (SLO) requirements on clouds through scalability and reliability The big challenge for Cloud customers is to evaluate SLAs of cloud vendors. There are two types of SLAs in a cloud computing environment: SLAs between the end user and the cloud client, and SLAs between the cloud client and the cloud infrastructure provider. This paper investigates the cost/performance trade-off from the cloud clients perspective. From the cloud clients point-of-view the auto-scaling goal is to reduce resource cost (i.e., the cost of the leased resources from the IaaS provider) and the SLA violation cost (i.e., the cost that is associated with the SLA breaches), at the same time. Public cloud Most services are offered in a public environment in which consumers can access a resource pool that is managed by a host corporation [14]. Because of its existence, this type of environment will pose important concerns regarding security issues [15]. Private cloud A third party vendor provides the services which distinguish it from public accesses [16]. Therefore it is better than the previous development model because it prevents unauthorized access. Community cloud The cloud services are provided to a specified group where all members are entitled to equal access to the sheared services [17]. Hybrid cloud The cloud services are provided as multiple cloud combustion (public cloud, private cloud, and community cloud) [18]. It might just inherit any kind of vulnerability or risk which resides within the parties listed above Security requirements represent a major issue that has to be met in order of easing some of these obstacles (Alam 2020) 1.2 Migration to cloud approaches 1.3 Use case References "],["part-ii-tba.html", "Chapter 2 Part II (TBA) 2.1 Networking 2.2 Security 2.3 Monitoring 2.4 Use Case", " Chapter 2 Part II (TBA) 2.1 Networking 2.2 Security 2.3 Monitoring 2.4 Use Case "],["part-iii-tba.html", "Chapter 3 Part III (TBA) 3.1 Infrastructure as Code 3.2 Data Governance 3.3 Use Case", " Chapter 3 Part III (TBA) 3.1 Infrastructure as Code 3.2 Data Governance 3.3 Use Case "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
